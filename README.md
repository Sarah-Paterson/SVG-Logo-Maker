# SVG Logo Creator

## Description

In this project, I worked with javascript to create a SVG logo creator that uses terminal prompts to generate a quick user designed logo. I was motivated to create a simple logo creator that can be used to represent logos temporarily as the website is built and the graphic designer is finalizing the company design. In order to be assured that the code is working properly, I also created test files to test the functions of this SVG logo creator.

This code was created for the purpose of giving the user a simplified way to create a simple SVG logo file for their projects. It provides the opportunity to design a simple logo with a few prompts in the terminal for a more simplified option versus using other more complicated and sometimes pricy programs to generate a simple SVG logo.

Through the process of coding the SVG logo creator javascript files, I was able to learn more about connecting multiple javascript files to communicate with each other locally avoiding a single long and complicated javascript file. I also learned a lot about testing code with jest and testing javascript files.
